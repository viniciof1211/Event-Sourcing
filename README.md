# Event Sourcing Enterprise Integration Pattern
Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern where the state of an application is determined by a sequence of events. Instead of storing the current state of an object, the system stores a log of all events that have occurred, enabling features like auditability, temporal queries, and scalability

This repository demonstrates the implementation of the **Event Sourcing** design pattern in Python. Event Sourcing is a powerful architectural pattern where the state of an application is determined by a sequence of events. Instead of storing the current state of an object, the system stores a log of all events that have occurred, enabling features like auditability, temporal queries, and scalability.

## Features

- **Event Store (Hub)**: A centralized log where all events are stored.
- **Microservices**: Example microservices that source events to the hub.
- **OOP Principles**: Reusable and extensible code following polymorphism, interfaces, and inheritance.
- **Example Use Case**: Create and replay events to reconstruct the state of an aggregate.
